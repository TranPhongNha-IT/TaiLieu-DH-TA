               ARTICLE 1:  GENERAL PRINCIPLES

               1.   This Charter does not reiterate the provisions of Vietnamese law applicable to
                     joint stock companies, Shareholders of the Company, the Board of Directors, the
                     Audit committee, the Chief Executive Officer, Enterprise managers, employees,
                     and the Trade union, except where otherwise specified in this Charter, as such
                     provisions will always remain applicable regardless of whether they are specified
                     in this Charter.

               2.   This Charter does not reiterate the phrase “in accordance with the provisions of
                     Vietnamese law” because all parties must always adhere to, be governed by, and
                     uphold Vietnamese law in all circumstances.
               3.   In cases where the provisions of the law related to the operations of the Company
                     are not addressed in this Charter, or in cases where there are provisions of law
                     that differ from the provisions of this Charter, the applicable law shall prevail and

                     measures, the meeting invitation notice does not need to detail the organizational
